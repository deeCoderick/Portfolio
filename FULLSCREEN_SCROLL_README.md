# Fullscreen Seamless Scrolling Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds seamless fullscreen scrolling to your portfolio landing page, where each section takes up the full viewport height and scrolling snaps between sections for a smooth, app-like experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Full Viewport Sections**
- All main sections now occupy the full viewport height (100vh)
- Sections are properly centered with flexbox layout
- Responsive design maintains functionality across all device sizes

### 2. **CSS Scroll Snap**
- Uses native CSS `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` for smooth section transitions
- Each section has `scroll-snap-align: start` for precise alignment
- Mobile uses `y proximity` for more natural touch scrolling

### 3. **Enhanced JavaScript Controls**
- **Mouse wheel**: Scroll up/down to move between sections
- **Touch/swipe**: Swipe up/down on mobile devices
- **Keyboard**: Arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home/End navigation
- **Click navigation**: Scroll indicator dots for direct section access

### 4. **Visual Scroll Indicator**
- Right-side dots showing current section position
- Clickable navigation dots for quick section jumping
- Responsive design (hidden on mobile for clean UX)
- Accessibility-compliant with proper ARIA labels

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- Hardware acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Throttled scroll listeners to prevent performance issues
- `will-change` hints for browser optimization
- Smooth scrolling polyfill for older browsers

### 6. **Accessibility Features**
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Proper focus management for scroll dots
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly with ARIA labels

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:
- `assets/css/fullscreen-scroll.css` - All styles for fullscreen scrolling
- `assets/js/fullscreen-scroll.js` - JavaScript logic for scroll behavior

### Modified Files:
- `index.html` - Added CSS and JS file includes

## How It Works

1. **CSS Setup**: Each section gets `min-height: 100vh` and `scroll-snap-align: start`
2. **JavaScript Initialization**: Script detects all main sections and creates scroll controls
3. **Scroll Detection**: Monitors scroll position and updates active section indicators
4. **Navigation**: Handles wheel, touch, and keyboard events for section navigation

## Sections Detected
The system automatically detects these main sections:
- Hero section (`#hero`)
- About section (`#about`) 
- Journey section (`#journey`)
- Skills section (`#skills`)
- Portfolio section (`#portfolio`)
- Recent Activity section (`#recent-activity`)
- Contact section (`#contact`)

## Usage
Simply scroll, swipe, or use keyboard navigation. Each action moves exactly one section at a time with smooth transitions.

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers: Full feature support with CSS scroll-snap
- Older browsers: JavaScript polyfill provides smooth scrolling
- Mobile: Optimized touch controls with swipe detection
- Reduced motion: Respects accessibility preferences

## Testing
Open your portfolio in a browser and try:
1. Mouse wheel scrolling
2. Touch/swipe gestures (on mobile/trackpad)
3. Arrow key navigation
4. Clicking the scroll indicator dots
5. Page Up/Down keys

Each method should smoothly transition between sections, displaying exactly one section per action.
